A monitor feeds them live aerial footage of the Carmarthenshire coastline. The image is crisp, they can make out dolphins swimming in the wake of a fishing trawler. They&#39;re testing the limits of the British Army&#39;s Watchkeeper surveillance drone, one of a new fleet of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) which have an \xA3850m pound price tag. </p><p data-v-91d6bce5> While the military have welcomed UAS as a way of reducing costs and casualties, not everyone is convinced.

They claim that when war can be fought without consequence to the aggressor, violence quickly becomes easier than diplomacy. </p></div></div></div>',1),h={__name:"articleView",setup(v){return l(),(p,_)=>{const t=s("footer-component");return i(),n(c,null,[e(r,{news:"#077AF9"}),m,e(t)],64)}}},g=o(h,[["__scopeId","data-v-91d6bce5"]]);export{g as default};
